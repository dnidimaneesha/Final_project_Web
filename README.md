# MERN-Stack-Final_Project_Web-Application
 Here the title of my web application was Online Store for beauty product Shop. Women are often the ones who spend most of their time shopping. They face various problems while shopping. To avoid all these problems, I created a web application for an online store for a beauty products Shop. Because young girls and women often want to be beautiful, I decided to create this web application targeting them. This web application allows the customer to buy different types of makeup items as well as nail polish and gifts. The purpose is to deliver the selected product to the customer within a few days.
The central concept of the web application is to allow the customer to shop virtually using the Internet and allow customers to buy the items and accessories of their desire from the store. The information pertaining to the products is stored on MongoDB at the server side (store). The Server process the customers and the products are shipped to the address submitted by them. this web application was designed for customers who wish to buy beauty Items. 
The end user of this product is a departmental store where the application is hosted on the web and the administrator maintains the database. In the application which is deployed at the customer database, the details of the items are brought forward from the database for the customer view based on the selection through the menu, and the database of all the products is updated at the end of each transaction. Data entry into the application can be done through various screens designed for various levels of users. Once the authorized personnel feeds the relevant data into the system, several reports could be generated as per security.
this web application was developed in such a way that the customer and admin can use it.
